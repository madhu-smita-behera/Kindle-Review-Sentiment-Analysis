# Kindle-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project helps in sentiment analysis on Kindle Book review. 

## Dataset
Dataset is obtained from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/amazon-kindle-book-review-for-sentiment-analysis?resource=download kaggle website and it contains 982619 entries. Each reviewer has atleast 5 reviews and each product has atleast 5 reviews in this dataset.

## Steps followed in this project
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning (Feature Engineering)
2. Train-test split
3. BOW, TFIDF, Word2Vec
4. Train ML algorithms (Naive Bayes algorithm, Random Forest classifier)

## Conclusion
The dataset showed 54% accuracy with naive bayes algorithm which increased to 79% acucracy with random forest classifier algorithm. It might increase with word2vec vectorization technique.
